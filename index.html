         <!-- History -->
         <section>
            <p>Linux has been around since Linux Torvalds first shared the Linux kernel in 1991.  He built the kernel while enrolled in a Unix class at the University of Helsinski.  According to Wikipedia, Linus became frustrated during the course when the operating system MINIX, that was included in the textbook for the class, could be used for educational purposes only.  That became the reason he began to work on a kernel of his own.  Without this, Linus has stated, he never would have made the Linux kernel. </p>
            
            <p>By making the kernel open-source, programmers have continued updating the kernel and using it to make many different versions of Linux.  These various distros of Linux are all open-source, and with a few exceptions, completely free for us to download and install on our computers.</p>
